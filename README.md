OMG just finished 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩𝘪𝘯𝘨 Screamboat and dude, what even was that ending?! Like, I'm still trying to wrap my head around it. You know when you 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 the   thinking it’s just gonna be a fun ride, but then BAM, it’s like a twist after twist. I'm here like, seriously, are they just trying to mess with my brain cells? 

So there’s this part, right, with the raccoon? I mean, no spoilers but... why is there ALWAYS a raccoon somewhere? Like, who's the guy obsessed with raccoons in these  s? 😂 What is life even at this point? And the whole steamboat vibe, such a wannabe classic horror aesthetic. I swear there were moments I was just like, okay this is either genius or trash, or both, you know what I mean?

Anyway, the characters! The leading dude? Total cliché, right? Then there's this whole subplot with the captain, and I'm thinking, HOLY CRAP,” and then the next minute I’m like, “oh, never mind, false alarm.” Like, where’s the consistency? Can’t even trust a horror 𝘧𝘪𝘭𝘮 to keep the same mood for five minutes, but also like, why would you even expect that? But it was kinda entertaining to 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 the   unfold. Kind of like a horror carnival ride, lots of screams and laughs.

> Then there’s the music at the end, like I'm just sitting there and this epic score kicks in. Felt like one of those moments they try and make a mediocre flick seem all dramatic. That's like the whole point there, right? Play some heavy strings and hope we don't notice.

And tbh, I caught myself kinda rooting for the monster at some point? I don’t even know, maybe it's the exhaustion talking, seriously gotta catch some sleep soon. Anyway, if you haven't seen it, like, do you even want to waste that time? Might end up just dissecting the plot holes more than anything.

for i in range(5): print(???)

I still can't get over how they thought painting the yacht's backstory as spooky would hold. But you know what? Life's too short, maybe I'll 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 it again when my brain feels less scrambled or maybe I just won't, who knows!
